					<h2>O3 Bistro &amp; Lounge</h2>
						<span class=subtitle>print design &nbsp; / &nbsp; brand identity</span>
				</div><!--end project-popup-->
				<div class=popup-text>
					<p>This asian fusion bistro next to the San Francisco City Hall wanted to leverage it's prime location towards politicians &amp; symphony goers without putting off young professionals. Working off the interior designer's decor plans, typeface and colors were chosen to compliment the inside, as were the creations of the menus and logo.</p>
				<h3>Logo Objective</h3>
				<p>While the bistro serves food of asian influence, O3 does not pretend to be authentic asian cuisine. The bistro's intent was to be more of a modern and contemporary lounge/bar/bistro atmosphere, with the asian fusion food being the unique selling point. With that in mind, we agreed that the brandmark should be something that is contemporary, but also shows a nod to eastern aesthetics.</p>
				
				<h3>Ideation</h3>
				<p>Letting my mind free form in the early sketches, the eastern aesthetics was applied heavily. Since O3 is pronounced, <em>OH three</em>, I was very draw into emphasizing the letter &#8220;0&#8221;. Circle shapes are common in asian writing, so a less geometric &#8220;O&#8221; was the next step. As for the &#8220;3&#8221;, I chose to go the opposite direction and back to the future with a geometric &#8220;3&#8221; (font Gotham Black).   </p>
						
				<p>Eventually three distinct directions were realized &nbsp;<span class="popup-caption">see image 3</span>. The left one fell along the lines of the period table element, Ozone, which abbreviates to O3. I should probably mention that the name of the bistro comes from the fact that one of the bistro's partners own two separate restaurants in the city called Ozone and Ozone 2 [with no relations to O3 other than namesake]. Continuing along, the middle option's direction goes 100% into asian influence. While not completely on target with the original objective, I felt that a solution could be found with future permutations. The last one aimed at more geometric shapes, with the letters forming bold, thick lines, while the line over the &#8220;0&#8221; help slighting dissolve the letters into a foreground/background interaction. </p>
				
				<p>After much discussion, the periodic table element direction was the one chosen for more exploration.</p>

				<h3>The Logo</h3>
				<p>After some more refining of shapes and new obstacles addressed (such as the outdoor signage having to be a retangle shape), the O3 identity is realized into two variations of the same graphic mark. The rectangle version is reserved for mediums that need O3 to have instant recognition and places where white space is restricted, while the O3 that is cut of to the bottom right side of any canvas is reserved for mediums that allow for more white space interaction. </p>
				
				<p>In terms of color of the logo, the gray is derived from the outdoor signage maker's recommendation to ease the making the sign. For the type used on the menus and other collateral, a orange-bronze color accentuate the interior decor and atmosphere. There is also a orange gradient version of the logo for projects that need something more vibrant.</p>
				
				<p>The typefamily used is Myriad Pro, because the condensed font exudes prominence while being approachable. Also add that fact that the rest of Myriad Pro is a font that the O3 marketers have easy access to it when they need to write something out on Microsoft Word. </p>  
				
				<h3>Implementation</h3>
				<p>The two logo variations made it very flexible to apply the identity onto print and and web/digital collateral. The non-boxed logo interacts with supporting typographic elements. It can be bold on a business card, or it can play second fiddle in on the dinner menu. The boxed logo serves well for internet social networks or usage as an emblem. Check out everything in it's entirety for yourself the next time you're near San Francisco's City Hall; <em>O3 Bistro &amp; Lounge</em>.</p>

					<h2>blissmo</h2>
						<span class=subtitle>print &amp; web &nbsp; / &nbsp; branding &nbsp; / &nbsp; photography</span>
				</div><!--end project-popup-->
				<div class=popup-text>
					<p>Blissmo.com is an online service whose goal is to help consumers discover sustainable and eco-friendly products. With a logo already on hand, they needed a brand identity that conveys friendliness while maintaining a professional service. Print &amp; web collateral was created, as well as website, implementation of colors &amp; typefaces and product photos were taken.</p>
					
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>When I started at blissmo, they were a wordpress-powered daily deal site with a logo. I was then tasked to do some design work for their newly created monthly-subscription box of eco-products, <em>blissmobox</em>. Later on, the daily deals were to be revamped in to a e-commerce marketplace. Along the way, I worked on the brand identity to bring the multiple blissmo products together.  </p>						

				<h3>Initial Challenges</h3>
				<p>Biggest obstacle at the start was figuring out who the target audience was, as there was no official data or statistics to draw from the blissmo daily deals. Of course, one can surmise  that the audience are people who are into eco-friendly products, but that's only slightly less ambiguous than saying everybody. After some discussion and analyzing the social media fan pages (i.e. Facebook), it was decided the opinion leaders and people the brand shoould convey more to were women, ages 25 to 40, American. Besides interest from people in urban cities, there also seem to be interest from people in middle America.</p>						
				
				<p>Apart from the target, I was also allowed great flexibility in my design process. With the only requirements being that I keep the logo the same and to use more white color [sic], the way I handle the initial blissmo branding would set the tone for future blissmo projects. With that in mind, I set up checks and balances to stop myself from frivolous brand sidetracking, and to get feedback from peers accordingly.     
								
				<h3>the blissmobox</h3>
				<p>The blissmobox is a box of sustainable/eco-friendly products that's delivered monthly via a subscription-based business model. The middle of every month, the recipient has a few themed boxes to choose from, but they do not get to know what is in the box until he/she opens the box in person at the beginning of the next month.<br/><br/>  </p>

				<h3>branding motifs</h3>
				<p>You might have noticed some of the blissmo branding themes in the images above. First, I looked for a color to compliment the logo's blue. Some designers might find that orange is too obvious a solution, but whose to say that the obvious solution is a bad design solution? The brand needed something to bring more energy to the much reserved feel of the blue. The orange is applied carefully; used to draw attention to specific elements, or brighten up an overly blue layout. </p>	
				
				<p>While I did not create the blissmo logo, I decided to give the bloom-shaped brandmark a prominent position in the brand identity. It works well as a stand-alone emblem, a sort of &#8220;seal of approve&#8221; for products that are deemed eco-friendly, if you will. </p>	

				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider2/popup/11.png" class="" />
						<p class="caption">also created were supporting twirling blooms graphic for web elements that need a bit more attention</p>
				
				<h3>blissmo market</h3>
				<p>With a good audience built into the blissmobox and the daily deals, the next big step for blissmo was to turn the daily deals into a full blown e-commerce marketplace for sustainable/eco-friendly products. for that, a few new elements to the blissmo identity will be needed. [Project currently in development] </p>

						<p class="caption">icons represent certain attributes that a product being sold via blissmo has. Will also be used for other blissmo branding</p>
						
				
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>In conclusion, there is no conclusion. I feel that the brand identity done here succeeds in portraying a sense of friendly professionalism without falling into cliches of what eco-friendly branding should be (i.e. THE COLOR GREEN AND OVERUSED LEAF SHAPES). The brand's web and print designs are flexible enough to encompass a good variety of future blissmo projects. At least until there is refined research and data into the target demographic, in that case, the branding strategy and identity will need some revisions.  </p>

					<h2>Fitsoft</h2>
						<span class=subtitle>web design &nbsp; / &nbsp; brand identity</span>
				</div><!--end project-popup-->
				<div class=popup-text>
					<p>Fitsoft.com is a web management system for small to big gyms/facility operations in the fitness industry. Aside from also aiming to be the go-to search directory for fitness consumers, their ambitious strategies have since created a bunch of web content and backend system that needs a flexible identity to bring it all together.</p>
					
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>This project is currently still in development, so I can't disclose too much on how the brand identity and UI relate the Fitsoft marketing strategies and such, but I will explain what I'm limited to. Fitsoft is made up of two main directions: first direction is a web &amp; mobile app platform for gym/fitness facilities to manage all their activities and website content, all in one digital space. Second part of Fitsoft is to create a search directory for local people to find gyms and classes. Combined, it creates a eco-system of fitness businesses and fitness customers, all under the umbrella of Fitsoft.</p>						

				<h3>Obstacles / Direction</h3>
				<p>In a broad and general perspective, the targets for Fitsoft are people who like exercising and the businesses that provide exercising activities. As I've learned in school, selling your product to businesses (also known as &#8220;b to b&#8221;) has distinct differences compared to selling to consumers (a.k.a. &#8220;b to c&#8221;). I'll admit, creating a brand identity in both <em>b to b</em> and <em>b to c</em> is quite task to undertake, especially working with limited resources for a product that is still in a inchoate state (in pre-beta development).</p>
				
				<p>After comprehending the situation and limitations, I decided to put the majority of the time to focus on the Fitsoft Directory (the product for consumers). The goal was now to emphasis the <em>colors</em> of Fitsoft, as and less of the logo of Fitsoft. The thought process behind it was that it is more flexible to apply color to the developing Fitsoft business management platform that it was to establish too many graphical rules right out the door.  
				</p>						
				
				<h3>Branding Themes</h3>
				<p><em>What does color does one think of when talking about fitness and exercise?</em> That was one of the first questions I asked myself. What color appeals to people who practice a calm activity like yoga, AND to those of the more physical mixed martial arts? The solution was not just a specific color, but a specific color palette.   </p>

				<p>With some image searches, article readings, and color palette sites like <em>kuler dot com</em>, the five colors of Fitsoft was found. The key colors are the red-orange and orange, while the rest are more secondary in usage (more of accents colors). The reason being that the red-orange and orange is more universal when relating to a range of exercises. The colors also might bring up a <em>Gestalt effect</em> for consumers, as the color combined with texture patterns conjure up reminders of padded walls/mats that are usually associated with fitness activities.<br/><br/></p>

				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider3/popup/1.png" class="" />
						<p class="caption">the Fitsoft color palette <br/>(will be a reoccurring graphic in the brand's designs)</p>

				<p>As for the Fitsoft logo (created by another designer), it works solidly with all the Fitsoft projects, but is very self containing logo. This attribute works extremely well for the Fitsoft business platform. With the directory, however, there will need to be other visual elements in place to offset the logo. </p>

				<p>As for typefaces, the logo and print collateral's typeface family is Franklin Gothic. Having traditional forms in it's alphabets' shapes, it compliments the Fitsoft logo's shapes. For the internet, web-optimized fonts such as Aller and Crete Round are used. Aller is reminiscent of Franklin Gothic, though more playful (which works with the website layouts). Not to be ignored, Crete Round is used sparingly for emphasis. </p>

						<p class="caption">typefaces: Aller on top, Crete Round on bottom</p>
				

				<h3>Fitsoft Directory</h3>
				<p>Implementation of the identity into the Directory section of Fitsoft. The site layout is created to scale with the small/sizeable initial population of Fitsoft users. Revisions to be made when a larger scale audience is formed. </p>

				<h3>Onwards</h3>
				<p>Fitsoft is still in development. Hovering in the alpha stage right now, beta-users will be allowed soon. Things that have not been mentioned are the Directory's mobile app, nor the Business Platform's mobile management system, or the web cms&#8212;as they are currently sensitive information. Moving forward in the project, the next step is collect user feedback on the flow of the Fitsoft interfaces. The branding colors and other graphics will also be evaluated for its efficency, but not expect to cause any problems for the users. </p>

					<h2>Inked Studios</h2>
						<span class=subtitle>web &nbsp; / &nbsp; UI &nbsp; / &nbsp; brand identity</span>
				</div><!--end project-popup-->
				<div class=popup-text>
					<p>Inkedstudios.com aims to build an online art community while promoting up-and-coming artists, particularly those of urban &amp; street art. With the ability for artist to create their own galleries and have viewers collect or share them, a easy-to-follow interface that's approachable and flexible is key in the early stages of the site.</p>
					
				<h3>Strategy</h3>
				<p>With art sites like behance and deviantart, not to mention all the niche art showcase sites, why should any viewer care for another one? I suppose from a consumer prespective, they're all the same. But to someone with knowledge of the behind-the-scenes, Inked Studios has an interesting way in approaching this field. </p>

				<p>Inked Studios isn't trying to take on the big boys; it wants to work with established and up-in-coming [local] artists one-on-one. The idea is to find an artist (in this case, in the San Francisco Bay Area), work with them to create quality print poster/canvases, and then sell them to Inked Studio's audience and through social media networks. Currently the audience is being gathered organically via a Facebook fanpage, where art is shared with the followers. With a decent following so far, the next step would be to introduce them to a Inkedstudios site, that is where I come in.      

				<h3>Obstacles &amp; Direction</h3>
				<p>The color of green was established beforehand as the primary color for the brand. The next thing on the list was a strong brandmark. It was important that the graphic be strong and elegant, as it will be used in key elements on the web and in print collateral. After many variations via a few different internal designers, it was settled that the Ink Studio brandmark be..you guessed it, a ink drop. </p>

				<p>Cliche? Perhaps. But in this case, this icon can be prominently apply to many mediums&#8212; from being stamped into a certificate of authenticity for art prints, to use as a call-to-action button for the site. </p>

				<p>As for the site layout it self, the goal is to let the art speak for itself, while strategically creating a visual hierarchy of featured art pieces. A key concern was how we would allow the viewer to share the art easily while finding a reason to create an Inked Studios account.  </p>

					<h2>Aslan Bikes</h2>
						<span class=subtitle>logotype</span>
				</div><!--end project-popup-->
				<div class=popup-text>
					<p>In the midst of the fixed gear/singlespeed bike trend at the end of the decade, entrepreneurs were ready to jump onto the bandwagon and make some profit. With that said, I had the opportunity to create a headbadge/logo for some clients that were thinking of jumping into the fray.</p>
					
				<h3>Brief</h3>
				<p>The expectations of this logo was straight-forward: The clients wanted a lion, as to represent strength and regal, so they codenamed this singlespeed bike project &#8220;Aslan&#8221; (Chronicles of Naria influenced).</p>
				
				<p>To simplify: Problem &rarr; lion + bicycle = not the same. Solution &rarr; Mash them into one. Since the logos on bicycles are most commonly placed on the front steer tube of the bike, I made a prerequisite to keep it a self-contained shape. Being a bicycle hobbyist, I have some ideas in mind. But with lions, some studying of their physical features are needed, particularly their heads. </p>

				<h3>Process</h3>

						<p class="caption">Google images: good for studying animals without blowing money on an African safari </p>

				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider5/popup/2.png" class="" />
						<p class="caption">sketching lion heads to get a sense of how the strokes/lines flow; their manes intrigue me, as can be broken down and reduced to simply spatial shapes; Also interesting in drawing cats, depending on how the nose is created, differentials a big cat to a house cat</p>

				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider5/popup/3.png" class="" />
						<p class="caption">as for the bicycle, the parts I had in mind were the chainring, rear cog, and wheel. Note all they are all circular shapes</p>

				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider5/popup/4.png" class="" />
						<p class="caption">next stage was to try and mash em together; here were some of the more interesting ones</p>

				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider5/popup/5.png" class="" />
						<p class="caption">in the beginning of the project, I imagined that putting the lion into a circular bicycle-related shape was the way to go, and after some discussion and more sketches, it was decided that was the direction to taken. The rear cog shape was chosen, because singular cogs are used for singlespeed bikes, plus these cogs are more simplified, as they have lower teeth count than chainrings and lower spokes count than bike wheels.</p>

				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider5/popup/6.png" class="" />
						<p class="caption">a side profile of the lion was given much focus, as it was less static [and more asymetrical] than a lion facing forward. Side profile also gave more chances of manipulating the foreground/background relations, which also turned out to be the hardest part&#8212; as balancing and contrasting the lion and cog required much finessing </p>
						
				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider5/popup/7.png" class="" />
						<p class="caption">after a notable period of time spent pushing the white space back and forth, pixel by pixel, a harmony between the lion shape and the cog shape was finally formed</p>

				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider5/popup/8.png" class="" />
				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider5/popup/9.jpg" class="" />
						<p class="caption">the final touch was the lion's mane; I strategically placed four lines to represent not only the mane, but the curves of a velodrome (racing track for singlespeed bikes)</p>
											
				<img src="images/portfolio-images/1-showcase1/slider5/popup/10.png" class="" />
						<p class="caption">Black is the main logo color, but a green version was also added by request of client. Logo on bike mocks were also created for presentation purposes. Typeface used is <em>Patagonia</em>. </p>			

				<h3>In Closing</h3>
				<p>This project eventually ended before bike production ever started. Reason being that by the turn of the decade, the singlespeed bike trend had hit the mainstream, with many low-end, low-budget singlespeed bikes already being started up and sold, another bike company selling the same bike would not have much to gain.</p>
				
				<p>Nonetheless, the experience gained was still valuable. The process of the logo creation went well, as the finished logo met the goal and expectations I had envisioned in the beginning, becoming my most satisfying graphic creation yet. That is, until the next one. </p>
